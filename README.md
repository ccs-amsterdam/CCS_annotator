# CCS Annotator

This is the ReactJS Client for the CCS Annotator.
It is currently in active development, and the codebase can still change substantially.
As such, you are very much invited to install it to try it out and provide feedback,
and if you are interested in contributing to development or using certain components, let us know!

## Install and run

Installation should be straightforward via npm.

```
git clone https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/CCS_annotator
cd CCS_annotator
npm install
npm start
```

Depending on your env, you might have to run `npm install --only=dev` to install dev dependencies.
