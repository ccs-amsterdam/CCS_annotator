# AmCAT4 Annotator

This is a trial run for a ReactJS Client for doing manuall annotations with AmCAT4.
At the moment it actually has nothing to do with AmCAT, and I think the idea is that it should also work as a standalone tool.
Still, it's probably good to call it AmCAT.
It also doubles as a learning environment for react + redux, so don't get your hopes up just yet.

## Install and run

```
git clone https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/amcat4annotator
cd amcat4annotator
npm install
npm start
```
